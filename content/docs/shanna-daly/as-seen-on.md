  - Title: Overcoming cognitive bias
  - Description:
    - Cognitive biases are human errors that lead to an irrational or incorrect conclusion based on a particular person's view of the world. For each of us, our individual biases drive our decisions every day; from where we sit on the bus, who we get our coffee from and how we do our work. These biases are based on many factors, including our upbringing, belief system, personal experiences, and education and if run unchecked in security operations, can impact the security of an organization. When building a team to run cyber investigations diversity can be the key to breaking the bias and I'll talk through what some of these biases look like in the real world and some of the ways I have tried to combat them through hiring team members from diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
