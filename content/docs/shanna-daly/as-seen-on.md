* **(Presentation) Threat Intelligence without boiling the ocean**

    Whilst no one will ever tell you that threat intelligence is easy, setting out on the path to use it in smart ways doesn't need to be overwhelming. The amount of open source intelligence feeds, documents, blog posts and information shared in the community can easily become overwhelming, but there are some ways we can tackle this without jumping in the deep end, so to speak.

    Drawing on Shanna’s deep experience in mitigating cyber threats, and Mike’s extensive collection of espionage tech, this talk will take you from housebreaking to Access Brokers, from typewriters to Keyloggers, from bugs and Kompromat cameras to RATS, from speech-over-IR to malware C&C - and more.

### AusCERT Conference 2022
*May 13, 2022*
* **(Presentation) Overcoming cognitive bias**

    Cognitive biases are human errors that lead to an irrational or incorrect conclusion based on a particular person's view of the world. For each of us, our individual biases drive our decisions every day; from where we sit on the bus, who we get our coffee from and how we do our work. These biases are based on many factors, including our upbringing, belief system, personal experiences, and education and if run unchecked in security operations, can impact the security of an organization. When building a team to run cyber investigations diversity can be the key to breaking the bias and I'll talk through what some of these biases look like in the real world and some of the ways I have tried to combat them through hiring team members from diverse backgrounds and skillsets.

### BSides New Orleans
*October 26, 2019*
* **(Presentation) Threat modelling in the land down under**

    Australia is (in)famous for its dangerous flora and fauna, most notably deadly spiders, snakes and jellyfish. We continually have to look at potential threats and assess our risk of basic things like venturing outside. This talk looks to help turn threat modelling exercises into something relatable, fun and educational. Too often security education is delivered in a dry format that is difficult for non security folks to digest, so let’s look at fun ways to turn that around!
