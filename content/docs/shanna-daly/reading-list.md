| [The Hacker and The State](https://read.amazon.com.au/kp/embed?asin=B082DLMC6L&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GJXQM5K5JS1ZMTW9FXA1) | Packed with insider information based on interviews, declassified files, and forensic analysis of company reports, The Hacker and the State sets aside fantasies of cyber-annihilation to explore the real geopolitical competition of the digital age. Tracing the conflict of wills and interests among modern nations, Ben Buchanan reveals little-known details of how China, Russia, North Korea, Britain, and the United States hack one another in a relentless struggle for dominance. His analysis moves deftly from underseas cable taps to underground nuclear sabotage, from blackouts and data breaches to billion-dollar heists and election interference. |
| [Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/books-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis-2/) | The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis has been required reading for intelligence officers studying the art and science of intelligence analysis for decades. Richards Heuer, Jr. discusses in the book how fundamental limitations in human mental processes can prompt people to jump to conclusions and employ other simplifying strategies that lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. These analytic mindsets cannot be avoided, but they can be overcome through the application of more structured and rigorous analytic techniques, including the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses. |
| [The Spy in Moscow Station](https://www.amazon.com.au/Spy-Moscow-Station-Counterspys-Deadly/dp/1250301165) | In the late 1970s, the National Security Agency still did not officially exist--those in the know referred to it dryly as the No Such Agency. So why, when NSA engineer Charles Gandy filed for a visa to visit Moscow, did the Russian Foreign Ministry assert with confidence that he was a spy? Outsmarting honey traps and encroaching deep enough into enemy territory to perform complicated technical investigations, Gandy accomplished his mission in Russia but discovered more than State and CIA wanted him to know. |
