- [ ] Install VirtualBox using winget.

## **Installing VirtualBox with winget.**

1. Open a command prompt, to check if you have winget installed, run the following:
    `winget -v`
2. To search for the package you want to install:
    `winget search virtualbox`
3. You should see the package line item for VirtualBox and install with the following command.
