There might be some booing from the crowd, but we are going to do our digital forensic analysis on a Windows system and with some common tools that we can run within Windows to complete our mission.

## **Lab Objectives**

By the end of this lab you should be able to:
- [ ] Find where to download a copy of Microsoft Windows 10 evaluation version and download to your computer.
- [ ] Create a virtual machine in VirtualBox using the downloaded ISO image.
- [ ] Run through installing Microsoft Windows 10 and successfully login.
- [ ] Update language packs and date and time.
- [ ] Create a hard drive in VirtualBox and attach to a virtual machine.
- [ ] Format the hard drive within Windows.

## **Get a copy of Windows 10 and install**

First of all you will need a copy of the Windows operating system. We’ll demonstrate the labs using Windows 10. If you do not have access to a licensed copy of Windows 10, you can download evaluation versions directly from Microsoft.

[Windows 10 Enterprise | Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise)

> Note: These versions cannot be activated and once installed will last for 30 days and then the background will go black and the system will shut down every 30 days.

1. Go to the Microsoft site and select the ISO for the version of Windows 10 that suits your hardware. I’ve selected the English (United States) version. Download the ISO (and wait).

2. Once the ISO image has downloaded, open VirtualBox.
   
	![[Pasted image 20230809165923.png]]

3. Click on New and the window "Create Virtual Machine" will pop up. Fill in the information as shown in the image below.
	* Name: Introduction to DFIR
	* Folder: the folder location on your computer that you want to store the virtual machine information and hard drives.
	* ISO image: Do not select anything here yet.
	* Leave the rest as default
	* Then click Next.
  
	![[Pasted image 20230809172744.png]]

4. On the next page select a username and password. For simplicity sake I will choose:
	* Username: DFIRAdmin
	* Password: DFIRAdmin123!
	* Select Guest Additions checkbox.
	* Click Next
  
	![[Pasted image 20230809171435.png]]

> Do not use generic usernames and password for any systems that will contain real data. This is for the purposes of this course only.
1. The amount of hardware that you can give to the virtual machine will depend on the computer you are running on. I will assign 16GB to base memory and 4 CPUs to processors. Then click Next.
   
	![[Pasted image 20230809171658.png]]

2. We'll create our virtual hard disk now that will hold the operating system and where we will store our evidence files.
	* Once again the size of the disk will be relative to the disk space that you have available.
	* I've chosen 500GB.
	* Click Next.
  
	![[Pasted image 20230809172122.png]]

3. Review the summary and click Finish when you are ready.
	
4. Before starting the virtual machine, now go to settings and storage. We will now add the iso file to the Optical drive. Click OK.
   
	![[Pasted image 20230809172939.png]]

5. Click on OK and start the virtual machine. After a minute or so you should see the Windows Setup screen. Click Next and Install now.
   
	![[Pasted image 20230809173538.png]]

6.  The set up may take some time to complete. Make sure that you accept the license terms and Custom Install.
7.  Select the hard drive that you created to install the operating system on and next. Windows will now install.
8.  Choose your region: For Example, Australia and then Yes.
9.  Choose your keyboard layout (for Australia US is correct).
10. Skip adding a second keyboard layout.
11. Finally you'll get to the point where you need to sign in or create an account. On this screen on the bottom left select "Domain join instead".
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809184357.png]]

12. Select a username and password, I am using the combination I chose earlier. Click through.
13. Turn all the options off on the privacy settings for your device window and accept.
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809184608.png]]

14. Cortana will not be helping us get things done, so select "Not now".
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809184914.png]]

15. There are a few changes that you can make while we are here, one being to change the default language to Australian. Click on the ENG symbol in the task bar and choose Language preferences. 
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809185844.png]]

16. Under Preferred languages I'm going to click on English (Australia) then options, and then download the language pack. Once that has been downloaded and installed you can go back to the language screen and choose English (Australia) as your default (and say no sign out later).
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809190219.png]]

17. While we are here, go to Date & Time from the left menu and select the Time zone of (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time.
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809190419.png]]

18. Some other useful tweaks to make to your windows system.
* Power settings:
    - Screen and Sleep > When plugged in, put my device to sleep after > set to Never.
- Automatic Updates
    - Advanced Options > Get me up to date > off
- Disable Windows Defender and add `c:\` to the exclusion list.

## **Setting up a second hard drive in VirtualBox**

We will want to have two hard drives attach the the virtual machine. I'll explain why in a little more detail throughout the course, but we'll create a second hard drive and attach it to our virtual machine for now.

> Tip: If you have a common set of tools or installers that you would like to have each time you start a new case, for example, FTK imager installer file, then you can create a separate storage drive that can be added to the virtual machine (or multiple virtual machines). Much like a shared network drive.

1. From the left tree window in VirtualBox, select the virtual machine you created and then settings. Go to Storage and select the 3rd icon under the storage devices window and choose "Hard disk".
2. A window hard disk selector will pop up.
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809191949.png]]

3. Click on create to open the Create Virtual Hard Disk wizard.
	* I've changed the size to 150GB
	* I've selected "Pre-allocate Full Size" for performance reasons.
	* Then click finish.
	
	![[Pasted image 20230809192216.png]]

4. The hard drive will be created.
5. Once it is created you need to attach it to your virtual machine.
6. Go the virtual machine settings then storage. Click on "Add hard drive" and select the drive you just created.
	
	![[Pasted image 20230825190231.png]]

7. Click choose and then ok. The disk is now attached.
## **Formatting the second drive in Windows**
Once you have created the hard drive in VirtualBox and attached it to your virtual machine, you'll need to format the drive ready for use in Windows.

1. Log into your Windows virtual machine.
2. Go tot he Start menu and then settings.
3. In the search box start typing "create and format hard disk partitions".
4. You should see a pop up asking you to initialise the disk
	
	![[Pasted image 20230825190604.png]]

5. Leave the defaults and click on OK.
6. This disk is now initialised and you can create the partition. Right click on the unallocated space and choose "new Simple Volume"
	
	![[Pasted image 20230825190724.png]]

7. Follow the wizard. You might want to call your drive something like "Data". Once it's finished you'll have a second hard drive attached.
