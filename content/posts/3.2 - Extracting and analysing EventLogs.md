# 1. Which User Shutdown Windows on February 25th 2019?

You can find this by Google: Event ID 1074: Logged when an app (such as Windows Update) causes the system to restart, or when a user initiates a restart or shutdown.
Where do we find these EventLogs on the Windows system?
* We’ll find that EventID in the SYSTEM EventLog.

## Obtain the EventLog Files &/or Directory with FTK Imager.



## Parsing the EventLogs with EZTools – EvtxECmd.exe.
▪	I’m going to create the csv file with EZTools and then import the data Timeline Explorer.

```PowerShell
PS F:\EZTools\Get-ZimmermanTools\EvtxECmd> .\EvtxECmd.exe -f F:\MUS2019CTF\Exported\EventLogs\System.evtx --csv "F:\MUS2019CTF\" --csvf system_evtlogs.csv
```

 

▪	Filter on 1074 event ID and payloadData3 column for “Type: power off”
 

## Using Autopsy to collect and analyse EventLogs.
▪	Go back to Autopsy and run another ingest module on the evidence.
▪	Deselect all and then choose “ParseEvtx”. Select SYSTEM from the right hand side.
▪	When the module has finished running the results will show under Data Artifacts > Windows Event Logs
▪	Sort by Event Identifier and find 1074
