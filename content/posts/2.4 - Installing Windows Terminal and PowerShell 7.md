# **Installing Windows Terminal

Windows terminal is my preference command line utility as I can run PowerShell, command Prompt, and WSL all in tabs with custom configuration. You can learn more about Windows terminalÂ [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).

## **Configuring Windows Terminal

Now that Terminal is installed, I set up a few extra profiles to make my workflow quicker. These include profiles that run as Administrator for PowerShell, Windows PowerShell and Command Prompt.
1. Go to Settings and the bottom of the left menu select "Add a new profile".
2. Duplicate profile and select the profile you want to duplicate, for example PowerShell.
3. Click Duplicate.
4. Rename to "PowerShell (Admin)".
5. Select "Run this profile as Administrator" and save.
6. Repeat for the other profiles you want too an Administrator prompt for.
